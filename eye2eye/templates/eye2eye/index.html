		Eye2Eye is a service organization founded by students at Alpha Kappa Psi Nu Chapter at Boston University in 2016. The inspiration to start Eye2Eye started in the spring of 2016 with a few students from Boston University. Having experienced and witnessed gender inequality <i>firsthand</i> within the business school at BU and throughout multiple industries, coupled with eye-opening research conducted by organizations like the ITUC, pushed the team to create Eye2Eye. As a start to its journey, Eye2Eye has two main goals:
	</p>
	<table class="eye2eyeGoalsTable">
		<tr>
			<td>
				<h2><strong>Hold a National Conference</strong></h2><p>to bring together professionals from various industries to discuss gender inequality and the best ways to fight it.</p>
			</td><td>
				<h2><strong>Conduct Proprietary Research</strong></h2><p>at BU to share at our national conference and begin to expand to other universities, becoming the nation's leading collegiate gender inequality research platform.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<p>
		We've decided to focus our efforts by breaking down the issue in four categories as defined by The 3% Movement's <a href="http://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2016/08/11/thousand-words-worth-picture-women-share-how-sexism-industry-has-affected-them" target="_blank">"Elephant on Madison Avenue"</a> survey. The survey was able to collect over 500 stories of gender inequality in the workplace and broke down some of the issues into the following categories:
	</p>
	<br>
	<table class="eye2eyeCategoryTable">
		<tr>
			<td class="box_purple">
				<h2>Sexual Harassment + Toxic Culture</h2>
			</td><td class="spacer"></td><td class="box_pink">
				<h2>Pay Inequality</h2>
			</td><td class="spacer"></td><td class="box_purple">
				<h2>Lack of Opportunity &amp; Visibility</h2>
			</td><td class="spacer"></td><td class="box_pink">
				<h2>The Motherhood Penalty</h2>
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<br>

	<p>

		The research continues and the issue of gender inequality is undeniable; something needs to happen. Eye2Eye is fully committed to continue collecting research and help raise awareness on the issue. With our annual conference, we aim to invite professionals from all industries from over the country to talk, discuss, and highlight some of the issues they have faced and noticed as well as how they work to combat this epidemic. Besides the conference, our team will be working hard to research different industries and gender inequality specific to Boston University. If our research is informational and unique, we hope to expand to other universities and help lead the gender inequality research platform among colleges throughout the United States.

		Research being everyday proves that there is a problem. For example, according to <a href="http://www.ilo.org/washington/areas/gender-equality-in-the-workplace/WCMS_159496/lang--en/index.htm" target="_blank">public information collected by the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC)</a>, "the global gender pay gap ranges from 3 percent to 51 percent with a global average of 17 percent." As noted in <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/faith-popcorn/you-cant-see-the-future-f_b_1463114.html" target="_blank">You Can't See the Future From the Man-Cave</a> by Faith Popcorn of the Huffington Post, "A <a target="_blank" href="http://www.catalyst.org/file/445/the_bottom_line_corporate_performance_and_women%27s_representation_on_boards_(2004-2008).pdf">study by Catalyst</a> found that those Fortune 500 companies with the most female directors outperformed those with few, or none. And those with at least three women at the boardroom table dramatically outperformed the rest. And the numbers were huge: 84 percent return on sales; 60 greater percent return on invested capital, and 46 percent greater return on equity."

		To combat the problem Eye2Eye has decided to begin doing it's own research, right here at home. While we have decided to present our findings at our conference this coming spring, our research analysts have started blogging about their experiences.
